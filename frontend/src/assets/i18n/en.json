      "From the internet cafes of my childhood where I started working, to today, my journey is marked by a passion for technology and supporting businesses with IT solutions, technical support, and automation. I've worked as a freelancer, in the family IT company, and in industries such as gas and energy (Petrobras), tobacco (Philip Morris), legal, and critical financial infrastructure (Central Bank/Anbima/SELIC). This diversity has forged my technical versatility and strategic vision. Analytical and solution-oriented, I identify bottlenecks and create automations that generate measurable efficiency. I adapt easily to large corporations or dynamic contexts, standing out in creative solutions under pressure. More than executing, I understand contexts, propose improvements, and deliver value. I learn quickly, value collaboration, enjoy being useful and helping people, and seek challenges that combine innovation and business impact."
